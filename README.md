A Cartridge interface that converts MSX 5v signal levels to 3v, exposing an IDC connector for external devices that operates at 3v level.

Interface for MSX computers with level shift conversion to 3.3v. Allow MSX to use FGPA development boards such as Terasic DE0 and DE1 as generic peripherals.

THIS IS WORKING IN PROGRESS. THE BOARD IS BEING TESTED, AND REFERENCE DESIGNS CREATED.
